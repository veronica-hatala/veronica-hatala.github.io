                <p>
        Hey! I'm Veronica, and I love bringing development projects to life. Coding is my profession, hobby, and
        a way that I can give back to my community by volunteering. I'm always eager to learn more and improve
        my skills as a developer and designer. I have previous professional experience using PHP, WordPress, HTML,
        CSS and Sass, JavaScript, and React. Web design is a newer venture of mine, and I'm learning more everyday while working
        with Figma, Inkscape, and GIMP. I also have experience optimizing for SEO through content writing and improving Core Web Vitals,
        tracking site statistics using Semrush, Google Analytics, and Google Search Console, and compiling those stats into Google
        Looker Studio. I'm really passionate about the web and the work that I do, and I'd love to bring that passion to your team.</p>
